Scraps is a static site generator based on Markdown files written with simple Wiki-link notation, designed for personal and team knowledge management.

# Concept
Scraps is built on three core concepts:

## 1. Atomic Knowledge Management
Knowledge is broken down into atomic "Scrap" units that connect without redundancy, reducing cognitive load for readers.

## 2. Simple Writing Experience
Markdown files with simple Wiki-link notation enable intuitive knowledge expression. [[Tag link|Tags]] are represented as `[[Tag1]]` for non-existent titles.

## 3. Integration with Various Tools
As a command-line focused SSG, it integrates seamlessly with:
- Git for version control
- GitHub for collaborative editing
- VSCode/Nvim with [[Language Server Protocol]] for development
- GitHub Actions for automated deployment [[GitHub Pages]]
