#[[CLI]]

```bash
❯ scraps build
```

This command processes Markdown files from the `/scraps` directory and generates a static website.

**Source Structure**
```bash
❯ tree scraps
scraps
├── Getting Started.md
└── Documentation.md
```

**Generated Files**

The command generates the following files in the `public` directory:
```bash
❯ tree public
public
├── index.html      # Main page with scrap list
├── getting-started.html
├── documentation.html
├── main.css       # Styling for the site
└── search.json    # Search index (if enabled)
```

Each Markdown file is converted to a slugified HTML file. Additional files like `index.html` and `main.css` are generated to create a complete static website.

## Examples

```bash
# Basic build
❯ scraps build

# Build with verbose output
❯ scraps build --verbose

# Build from specific directory
❯ scraps build --path /path/to/project
```

After building, use [[Reference/Serve]] to preview your site locally.
