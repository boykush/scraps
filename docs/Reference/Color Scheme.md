#[[Theming]]

Scraps defaults to either light mode or dark mode depending on the user's OS settings.

If you want to fix the color scheme to a specific mode, please modify your `Config.toml` as follows. See the [[Configuration]] page for details.
```
# The site color scheme (optional, default=os_setting, choices=os_setting or only_light or only_dark)
color_scheme = "os_setting"
```
