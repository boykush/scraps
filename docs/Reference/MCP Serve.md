#[[CLI]]

```bash
❯ scraps mcp serve
```

This command starts an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables AI assistants like Claude Code to directly interact with your Scraps knowledge base.

## Examples

```bash
# Basic MCP server
❯ scraps mcp serve

# Serve from specific directory  
❯ scraps mcp serve --path /path/to/project

```

The MCP server provides tools for AI assistants to search through your content and list available tags, enabling intelligent assistance with your documentation.
