#[[Integration]]

This guide shows you how to install the Scraps Claude Code plugin, which provides MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration for seamless AI assistant interaction with your Scraps knowledge base.

## Installation

Install the Scraps plugin using Claude Code:

```bash
claude plugin install boykush/scraps
```

That's it! The plugin will automatically use the current directory as your Scraps project path.

## Custom Project Path (Optional)

If you want to specify a different Scraps project path, set the `SCRAPS_PROJECT_PATH` environment variable:

```bash
export SCRAPS_PROJECT_PATH="/path/to/your/scraps/project"
```
