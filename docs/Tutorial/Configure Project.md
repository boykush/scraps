To get started with your Scraps site, you need to edit at least two required fields in your `Config.toml` file.

## Step 1: Edit base_url

Replace the placeholder URL with your actual site URL:
```toml
base_url = "https://yourusername.github.io/your-repository/"
```

## Step 2: Set your site title

Add your desired site title:
```toml
title = "My Knowledge Base"
```

## Optional Configuration

Only the `base_url` and `title` variables are required. Everything else is optional.

See [[Reference/Configuration]] for all available configuration variables and their default values.
